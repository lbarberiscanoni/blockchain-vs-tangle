## ML for Blockchain

We plan on testing two hypthesis

1) Can we build a recommendation system to optimize the blockchain? 

Right now, most blockchains use recency as the metric to determine which transactions go on the block. 

2) Can Reinforcement Learning optimize the blockchain? 

Ideally, the best DAOs would have an AI managing the blockchain they operate under.
